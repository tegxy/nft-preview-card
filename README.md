## The Challenge:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Use Grid

- Use Flexbox
- Create background image


### Process

- Built with

What I learned Being that I'm still learning frontend development, I was able work on a few things for the first time and understand them properly. Some of the CSS properties were:

- How to use Grid
- Mixing units and using them at the appropriate time
- Adding media queries
- How to use positioning properties to create background image
- How and when to use "z-index"
- Understanding different viewports (Tablet screens, Laptops and Smartphones)
- Understanding "min and max" inputs
- More knowledge on divs, their height and width
- Use HTML semantics
- Making site compatile to other device resolutions
